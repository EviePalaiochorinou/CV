# Evie Palaiochorinou

After a few years of experience in many different work fields, I wanted to put all my focus on a new challenge, and as a creative person, software development really appealed to me. I love working on projects and seeing them come to life, whether that's a collection of materials that become handmade soap, or a few lines of code that inspire a fully fledged web app.

In October 2021 I joined the Makers Academy development bootcamp, where I learned the fundamentals of software development through fun projects (like this one).
